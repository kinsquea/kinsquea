Hey! I'm glad you found me and my page.

As I work on improving my skills and knowledge as a web developer, I am posting my stepping stone projects here. I am currently working on my personal porfolio using the skills dipslayed in my smaller projects. Ignore the colours! The UI design aspects can be dealt with after (haha). I hope to collaborate with more people and build a greater passion for coding.
